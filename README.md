This repository contains a simple Rust program that illustrates a common error involving mutable and immutable references. The `bug.rs` file shows the error, while `bugSolution.rs` provides a corrected version.  The error arises from attempting to modify a value indirectly through an immutable reference, which is disallowed by Rust's borrowing rules to prevent data races and maintain memory safety.
